How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It helped me find the differences, hence the bug that was there

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would be easier to spot bugs and revise it later

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    Pros: You can choose the "perfect" place to create a commit
    Cons: You could possibly make a commit in the wrong place

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They each have their separate purposes with their separate structures.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    If you know how to use them properly, they can help you find the bug faster.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    You could code faster because if something breaks, you can easily go back and find out what happened and fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it as a version control tool and make myself a 
    better programmer
