When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you have collaberators working on your project on GitHub and you don't want them all using your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So you can control what the public sees (MyFarms dev, pre, and prod are perfect examples)
